GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list

Ok so this is what you will need to work on for this ---> this will replace your current createThought route (or you can just modify it)
1. In the routes - you will need to modify the post route to take in a userId as a parameters (so it know who the thought belongs to) will look like this router.route('/:userId').post(createThought);
2. Use the req.params.userId to modify your createThought route --> it will still do the create part but in the .then you will actually grab the new thought's id (thought._id) and pass that into a query that grabs the user to then push that thought._id into the thoughts array
*Hint you will use findOneAndUpdate along with $push for the mongo db part
If you look at your addReaction - it will be VERY similar to that how it updates the Thought and pushes a reaction to it's array (but instead will be updating a User and pushing the thought to it's array named thoughts)
